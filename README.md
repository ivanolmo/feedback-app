# Feedback UI

This project was made with a React course. It's meant to leave ratings (for a product/service, etc),\
and those ratings are persistent and can be edited or deleted.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\

### `npm run server`

Launches the mock json server which gets its data from the db.json file.\
You can view the data by launching [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

While a deployment bundle can be built, this app isn't meant to be deployed. We're using a\
local mock server to test functionality, and I have no plans to set up a real backend and db.
